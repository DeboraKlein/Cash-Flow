# 💰 Cash Flow Dashboard

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🚀 Here, you'll find projects related to **finance**, **data visualization**, and **business intelligence**.

## 📊 My Cash Flow Dashboard
I designed a **Cash Flow Dashboard** with interactive elements for better financial insights. It includes:
- **Balance Overview** (Opening Balance, Closing Balance, Incomes, Expenses)
- **Expense Breakdown** (Bar chart with detailed tooltip for invoices, cost centers, and locations)
- **Profit Analysis** (Gauge chart for profit margin)
- **Monthly Trends** (Waterfall chart showing balance evolution)
- **Filters & Bookmarks** (Interactive slicers for dates and cost centers)

  > **Note:** This dashboard is built with **fictitious information** and does not represent a real company.
